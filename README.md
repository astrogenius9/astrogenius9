## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a curious and quick learner who loves to tinker with any project that comes my way. Once I pick up a problem, I’m relentless—I just can’t stop until it’s solved! My passion for coding is matched only by my love for building things, especially on the web.

- 💻 **Frontend Dev:** Crafting beautiful, responsive interfaces is my jam.
- 🐍 **Python Lover:** Python is my go-to for projects, scripts, and fun explorations.
- 🪟 **OS & Cyber Security:** I enjoy diving into the depths of operating systems and security topics.
- 🧩 **DSA Enthusiast:** Data structures & algorithms are my playground—they scratch an itch in my brain that I just can’t ignore!
- 👀 Always looking for new things to learn and build.
- 🚀 Tinkerer at heart—if it’s interesting, I’m building it.
